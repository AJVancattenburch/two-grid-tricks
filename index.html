In a couple of years, I will be looking back on these projects with gratuitous nostalgia.  I am very excited to start my career as a Software Developer and know in my soul that within two years that my innovative dynamism will bring my family bountiful success in ways that will help humanity and our planet.  I walk into the future with endless intent and agency.</p>

The greater and less than (ex. >) symbols just be separated from the h4 element.  This is because if the font "header" size were surrounded by these symbols it would not be readable, but would increase the size of the given test that is wrapped in said header element.</p>

            <p>By examining this paragraph in "localhost", we can dictate that it is indeed located in the "Card Left" quadrant.

The "dev" tools are a very useful tool where you can get hands-on experience with what DOM manipulation looks like when we can make it virtually tangible.</p>
